### Program Due with Firmware
Before connecting to the Controller V1.1 Assembly, program the Due with Load the factory test firmware "MAX31850_Tester.ino" 

## Finish Assembly

#### Build Up MAX31850 Thermocouple Amplifier Sub Assemblies
Note that the side of the board to be up has the pads for configuring the addresses of the assemblies. 
Solder the header and screw terminal to the MAX31850 on the correct side.

1. Install the MAC13850 thermocouple amplifier assemblies to the Control V1.1 at JP9, JP10 and JP15.
Add a ?2.5mm? x 10 mm screw with nut as mechanice support and retention.
Observing polarity, connect thermocouples to the MAX31850 amplifire assemblies.
Cut the four on board shunt on each MAX31850 PCB (See image below for where to cut on one).  Measure with multimeter that the shunt to GND is open.

3. Add screws for legs such as 8-32 x 2") with nuts.  These legs are necessary because the long stacking connectors to be installed must not be bent which would happen if the legs were not installed.
4. Solder in the stakcing Due connectors, seven locations.  The long tails must go in the top and through to the bottom
5. Connect the Due to the Controller assembly.  The Due is under the Controller V1.1 assembly as a "shield".
6. Connect the Ethernet W5200 (or similar) sheild on the top of the Controller V1.1

### Apply power. 
Note the +12VIn, the +24VIn and the Stack programable power supply are connected to a switchable outlet switch.  
With the power outlet off, 
Connect the +12VIn power at J11, the RED connector.  
Connect the  +24VIn power at J12.  
Connect SSR simulator LEDS at  SSR1, SSR2, SSR3.
??? Do not connect the Stack power supply at J10 ( or J27) at this time. ???

Apply power by switching on the AC power strip.
**Test ID7:** Note current in table on the +12VIn supply current monitor for excessive, above 100 mA.  THIS NUMBER WILL NEED TO BE CHECKED WITH DUE's THAT HAVE NEVER BEEN PROGRAMED.
Check that the BUILDIN_LED ner the LAN Shield and SSR2 and SSR3 connectors is blinking rapidly as an idication that the firmware is running.
Open the Arduino Serial Plotter (<Ctrl> <Shift> <L>) and touch some thermocouples.

### Temperature Measurements.
**Test ID8:** Typical Serial Plotter results. Touching some of the thermocouples to ensure they respond.
Note resutls in table

Load the OEDCS firmware into the unit under test.  
Open the serial monitor. 
Observe the traffice and note that a Power supply  is reported.  
![image](https://github.com/PubInv/NASA-MCOG/assets/5836181/f4dca5d2-eb4a-4583-9b26-30fd3afd920a)  
Observe the traffice and note that an IP address is reported.  
![image](https://github.com/PubInv/NASA-MCOG/assets/5836181/607dcabb-5c68-43cf-8c0f-e29e81acb0e4)  
On serial port monitor confirm device connects to LAN **ID16**.  

#### Set Stack power supply and +24VIn.  
Connect a 1.5K 1/2 wat resistor load on the Stack Power Supply ouput.
With multi meeter observe the voltage on the stack power supply load.  
After observe and record voltage **ID16** after reset it should be 1V the power on voltage.
Send OEDCS serial port commands to set Stack power to load manual.
* s:1
* a:0.1
* w:2.5
Observe and record **ID17** Stack power to load should now be about 12V

### Observe data on Cumulocity

![image](https://github.com/PubInv/NASA-MCOG/assets/5836181/2a72fef9-9d39-459b-a6e8-70a8755b9307)
Observe and report **ID19**. 

### Reset to Safe
Press and hold the reset button.
Observe that the Stack power supply voltage goes to zero.  (IT DID NOT as of 20231218 with TF800A12K)
Observe that the blower stops.
Observe that the SSR LEDs go off.
Recorde results in test **ID19**  

### End of Test
Power off the unit under test.
Remove all connections including the jumper wire at J14 and J25.
Very carfuly so as to not bend pins, remove the LAN Sheild.
Very carfuly so as to not bend pins, remove the Due controller. A modified pop cycle stick helps.

## Rejoice another great OEDCS has been born!
