/*
Public Invention's COG Project is an open source hardware design for an oxygen
concentrator for use by field hospitals around the world. This team aims to
design an oxygen concentrator that can be manufactured locally while overcoming
challenges posed by human resources, hospital location (geographically),
infrastructure and logistics; in addition, this project attempts the minimum
documentation expected of their design for international approval whilst
tackling regulatory requirements for medical devices. Copyright (C) 2021

/*
  We have already done live testing of our DC power supply
  at high resistances. But we want a way to "smoke test"
  our power supply and wiring at high amperage. We have
  made a custom resistor of low ohmage (maybe about 0.3 or 0.4 ohms)
  which can survive high temperature because it is made or
  nichrome wire. Our goal here is remarkably simple, though
  it doesn't really corresponde to a typical "unit" test.
  Our basic goal is to read from the serial port a simple
  number and apply that many volts. Then we can walk the
  voltage up by hand, reporting the amperage, and checking
  that we can acheive high amperage without anything going
  wrong in our wiring (like getting too hot.)
