/*
  We have already done live testing of our DC power supply
  at high resistances. But we want a way to "smoke test"
  our power supply and wiring at high amperage. We have
  made a custom resistor of low ohmage (maybe about 0.3 or 0.4 ohms)
  which can survive high temperature because it is made or
  nichrome wire. Our goal here is remarkably simple, though
  it doesn't really corresponde to a typical "unit" test.
  Our basic goal is to read from the serial port a simple
  number and apply that many volts. Then we can walk the
  voltage up by hand, reporting the amperage, and checking
  that we can acheive high amperage without anything going
  wrong in our wiring (like getting too hot.)
