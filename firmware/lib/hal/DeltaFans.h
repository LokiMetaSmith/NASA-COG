// This is a driver for "dual mount" of this fan (which is itself
// two counterrotating fans:
// https://www.delta-fan.com/Download/Spec/GFC0412DS-TP01.pdf

// WARNING -- This code is now stale and exists only in case we
// have to ressurect or test the DeltaFans.


// NOTE: The current configuration does not allow less than
// 500 ml / s flow. These fans are very hard to control at
// low speeds. Possibly some other solution is required if
// that flow is too high. These fans can be turned off
// if we are remove the tachometer wire.
// If I separated these fans (I would have to desolder them).
// This would let us get down to 250 ml / s.

// Note: These fans produce a tach signal which is a PULL DOWN
// of about 500 Hz maximum. According to the documentation,
// there are 2 falling edges per one rotation?
// These are 4 pole fans.
